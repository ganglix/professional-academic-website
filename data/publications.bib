   abstract = {When rebar corrosion parameters are characterised from an electrochemical polarisation curve, the non-uniform rebar surface conditions need to be considered. In this research, a circuit model was developed to simulate the polarisation behaviour of rebar in concrete. It is found that the resistivity of concrete leads to non-uniform potential on the rebar, which causes the polarisation curve of the entire rebar to deviate from the Butler–Volmer kinetics. This, in turn, leads to an overestimation of the Tafel constants and the corrosion current density. Such deviations are more pronounced with higher concrete resistivity, especially when the active and passive rebar surfaces have a similar area ratio. The study recommends using potentiodynamic scans of representative reinforced concrete samples of the field conditions or the calculated parameters using an averaging technique, such as the proposed circuit model, to obtain accurate E-I curves or parameters for electrochemical modelling and corrosion rate prediction.},

   abstract = {This study developed a methodology for quantifying the corrosion parameters such as corrosion potential, corrosion current density and Tafel slopes for rebar in simulated pore solutions and mortar with realistic rebar conditions. We quantitatively investigated the impact of depassivation duration, chloride concentration, carbonation, and relative humidity on these parameters. Specifically, in partially saturated mortar, it was observed that the critical chloride content lacked a distinct threshold. The degree of depassivation, as indicated by shifts in corrosion parameters due to chloride ions and carbonation, was influenced by humidity.},

   abstract = {AbstractThis study deepens our understanding of rebar corrosion in cement-based materials like mortar and concrete, as compared to simulated pore solutions. The porous nature of mortar and variable water saturation levels are key factors that differentiate the corrosion behaviour of rebar in these real-world materials from that in bulk simulated pore solutions. While it is known that chloride ions, carbonation, and water saturation all contribute to rebar corrosion in concrete, their combined or synergistic effects have remained rather unclear. This research sheds light on these complex interactions by examining corrosion parameters for rebars in mortar with six levels of chloride content exposed to three levels of air relative humidity plus the immersed state, in carbonated and uncarbonated environments were determined and then analyzed by examining the water retention curves and bulk resistivity of these mortar samples. The effect of the water saturation level on corrosion was isolated from the combined effect of chloride contamination and carbonation and also their effects on bulk resistivity and water retention capacity. It was found that water saturation levels affect corrosion rates due to three factors: 1) an area effect, where the water content influences the rebar-pore solution area; 2) an ohmic control effect, where the bulk resistivity is influenced by water content; and 3) an anode-to-cathode ratio effect, where active or passive rebar surface conditions are influenced by water.In non-carbonated mortar, when there is no chloride, the main contributor to rebar corrosion rate is area effect. When there is chloride present, in addition to area effect, there also exists ohmic control and anode-to-cathode ratio effect. The chloride-indued rebar depassivation leads to non-uniform corrosion with a varying anode-to-cathode ratio dependent on water saturation. This non-uniform corrosion cell is at a scale large enough to be under ohmic control by the bulk resistivity, which is also dependent on water saturation.In carbonated mortar, the rebar corrosion behaviour is affected by both the anode-to-cathode ratio and the surface area. The rust scale on the rebar affects its anode-to-cathode ratio. When the rust scale is dry, the rebar is passivated, but when the scale is wet, the rebar becomes activated. This results in the dependence of the corrosion potential on the water saturation level in carbonated mortar. The degree of dependence varies based on the chloride content. When the chloride content is low, the electrical conductivity of the rust is highly dependent on water content, resulting in a more pronounced dependence of corrosion potential on water saturation. Conversely, when the chloride content is high, the dependence is less significant. The non-uniform corrosion cell occurs at a scale small enough that is not sensitive to bulk resistivity, resulting in less ohmic control. Finally, this study contributes towards the elucidation of the crucial link between rebar corrosion in simulated pore solutions and corrosion measurements within concrete or mortar samples.},
