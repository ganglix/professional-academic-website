Welcome to my professional webpage. I am a researcher and educator at the University of Saskatchewan, specializing in the durability of cement-based materials and the deterioration mechanisms of reinforced concrete infrastructures. My work bridges the critical gap between theoretical research and practical application.  

I develop software and hardware tools to present stakeholders with a clear perspective on the expected service life of structures. These applications also offer strategies for optimized maintenance schedules, prioritizing both cost-effectiveness and environmental sustainability.
