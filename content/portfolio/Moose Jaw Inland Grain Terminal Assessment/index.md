The Moose Jaw Inland Grain Terminal, constructed in 1910, is a multi-cellular concrete silo complex and one of the province’s oldest storage facilities still in operation. Recent inspections raised concerns about potential reinforcement corrosion due to concrete carbonation, prompting a detailed durability investigation to inform long-term maintenance planning.

**Engineering Contributions:**

- **Targeted Sensor Installation and Coring:**  
Moisture sensors were installed at nine key exterior locations to monitor environmental exposure conditions. Complementary core samples were extracted from the same sites to determine carbonation depth and verify sensor trends.

- **Carbonation Risk Modelling:**  
Using probabilistic deterioration models, we evaluated the carbonation front progression within the silo walls, integrating local concrete quality, cover depth, moisture exposure, and long-term meteorological data. This enabled a data-driven estimation of future corrosion risk.

- **Key Findings:**  
Although deeper carbonation was detected on interior wall surfaces, actual rebar corrosion was minimal—primarily due to insufficient moisture levels needed to sustain electrochemical reactions. 

- **Informed Maintenance Strategy:**  
Predictive modelling showed only 0.1 mm of expected reinforcement section loss by 2071. This insight enabled the asset owner to avoid unnecessary and costly full-scale repairs, opting instead for a visual monitoring and targeted intervention approach.

This project illustrates the impact of combining sensor technologies and advanced modelling in concrete durability assessments. Our findings provided the client with a clear, cost-effective roadmap aligned with actual service-life risks.
