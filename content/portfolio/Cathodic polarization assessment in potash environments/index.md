## **Engineering Services Delivered**

In support of performance evaluation in potash operations for a potash mining corporation, we conducted a structured assessment of cathodic polarization behaviour in representative brine environments. Through tailored laboratory testing and data interpretation, we characterized corrosivity and protection demand under different operating conditions.

This work informs cathodic protection design by identifying trends in corrosion potential, protection current demand, and mitigation effectiveness across varying solution chemistries and temperatures.

## **Core Outcomes**
- Delivered field-relevant corrosion data to support material preservation strategies.
- Identified environmental factors impacting the efficiency of cathodic protection.
- Contributed to risk-informed planning for infrastructure in corrosive industrial service.
