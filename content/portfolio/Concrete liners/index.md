## **Engineering Services Delivered**

In support of a potash mining corporation, we conducted a targeted evaluation of liner systems intended for reinforced concrete structures operating in challenging service environments. The objective was to determine the most effective protective lining solution to ensure long-term durability and structural integrity.

Commercial liners were applied to reinforced concrete specimens and subjected to prolonged exposure in a controlled environment simulating field conditions. The evaluation methodology included a combination of non-destructive and mechanical assessments to benchmark durability and protective performance.

This structured, multi-stage testing approach enabled the elimination of underperforming candidates and ensured the selection of the most suitable solution based on overall material performance and compatibility.

## **Core Outcomes**

- Identified a high-performing solution based on overall protection effectiveness.
- Screened out unsuitable options through systematic performance evaluation.
- Developed a practical framework to support protective system selection in aggressive conditions.
- Recommended additional investigation to enhance predictive maintenance planning.

The work delivered key insights to support infrastructure protection strategies in industrial applications and informed material selection practices for corrosive service environments.
