## **Engineering Services Delivered**

As part of our contribution to advancing the rehabilitation of the University Bridge, we implemented a field-based galvanic cathodic protection test system. This included the installation of embedded zinc anode panels, integration of monitoring instrumentation, and validation through long-term field observations and predictive modelling.

## **Project Highlights**

- Designed and implemented embedded zinc anode systems for corrosion mitigation
- Installed reference electrodes and centralized junction boxes for performance tracking
- Conducted early-stage benchmark testing to support future maintenance planning
- Applied predictive modelling to optimize design and confirm protective current distribution

## **Outcomes**

- Validated the effectiveness of GCP in moisture-prone regions
- Provided practical insights into spacing, material consumption, and current efficiency

This work exemplifies a performance-based engineering approach that combines field deployment and modelling to extend the service life of aging concrete structures.
