abstract: This study explored the corrosion of reinforcement in an old arch bridge
  under carbonation and chloride attack using a large-scale 3-D transport model. It
  incorporated a realistic microclimate representation around the bridge in terms
  of temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation. The model simulated critical
  microenvironment factors such as moisture, chloride concentration, and carbonation
  at the rebar depth. The corrosion rate was predicted considering the synergistic
  effect of carbonation and chlorides derived from site-extracted pore solutions and
  historical rebar. Field data from in-situ sensors measuring oxygen content, moisture,
  chloride, and carbonation in the concrete cover informed our analysis. Significantly,
  the field measurements ruled out the possibility of a limited cathodic current due
  to oxygen transport. The study found that the ineffective sheltering from rain or
  rainwater retention in some parts of the arch facilitated the chloride and carbonation
  penetration, leading to higher corrosion rates in those parts. The simulation results
  for the past 100 years of service agreed well with the current condition of the
  bridge and the projections for the next 50 years indicated a significantly increased
  corrosion over a larger area of the arch. Increased CO2 levels and precipitation
  substantially raised rebar section loss, intensifying overall corrosion. In contrast,
  higher CO2 levels with less precipitation reduced the maximum rebar section loss
  but did not affect overall corrosion. These findings suggested the need for varied
  infrastructure maintenance and management strategies.

summary: This study used a 3-D transport model to analyze corrosion in an old arch bridge's reinforcement under carbonation and chloride attack, factoring in realistic microclimates. Field data on oxygen, moisture, chloride, and carbonation levels informed the analysis. Findings show varying corrosion rates due to environmental factors, highlighting the need for diverse maintenance strategies according to climate scenarios.
