abstract: When rebar corrosion parameters are characterised from an electrochemical
  polarisation curve, the non-uniform rebar surface conditions need to be considered.
  In this research, a circuit model was developed to simulate the polarisation behaviour
  of rebar in concrete. It is found that the resistivity of concrete leads to non-uniform
  potential on the rebar, which causes the polarisation curve of the entire rebar
  to deviate from the Butler–Volmer kinetics. This, in turn, leads to an overestimation
  of the Tafel constants and the corrosion current density. Such deviations are more
  pronounced with higher concrete resistivity, especially when the active and passive
  rebar surfaces have a similar area ratio. The study recommends using potentiodynamic
  scans of representative reinforced concrete samples of the field conditions or the
  calculated parameters using an averaging technique, such as the proposed circuit
  model, to obtain accurate E-I curves or parameters for electrochemical modelling
  and corrosion rate prediction.
