abstract: This dataset provides comprehensive corrosion parameter data for reinforcing
  steel (rebar) in simulated pore solutions and mortar. It includes detailed measurements
  of corrosion potential, corrosion current density, and Tafel slopes under various
  chloride levels and carbonation treatments. The data aims to shed light on the corrosion
  behaviour of rebar in environments that closely mimic real-world conditions.
