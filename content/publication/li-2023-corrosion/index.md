abstract: This study developed a methodology for quantifying the corrosion parameters such as corrosion potential, corrosion current density and Tafel slopes for rebar in simulated pore solutions and mortar with realistic rebar conditions. We quantitatively investigated the impact of depassivation duration, chloride concentration, carbonation, and relative humidity on these parameters. Specifically, in partially saturated mortar, it was observed that the critical chloride content lacked a distinct threshold. The degree of depassivation, as indicated by shifts in corrosion parameters due to chloride ions and carbonation, was influenced by humidity.

summary: This research established a method to quantify corrosion parameters like potential, current density, and Tafel slopes for rebar in simulated conditions. It examined how depassivation duration, chloride concentration, carbonation, and humidity affect these parameters. Notably, in partially saturated mortar, no distinct threshold was found for critical chloride content, and humidity significantly influenced depassivation indicated by shifts in corrosion parameters.
