abstract: A customized Python module for interactive curving fitting in Jupyter Notebook
  environment right in the browser such as Chrome.   It allows users to interactively
  fit Butler-Volmer equations and its variations to potentiodynamic scan curves. The
  optimization process is powered by non-linear least squares algorithms from Scipy.
  It features a user-friendly plotting GUI with Jupyter Notebook widgets. This current
  release provides options for interactive data range selection, linear/log axis switching,
  auto-zoomed plotting, and post-IR compensation. The fitted results include corrosion
  parameters such as corrosion potential, corrosion current, Tafel slopes, polarization
  resistance, and goodness of fit (R2 score and Chi2 score).
