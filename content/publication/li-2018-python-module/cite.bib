 abstract = {A customized Python module for interactive curving fitting in Jupyter Notebook environment right in the browser such as Chrome. 

It allows users to interactively fit Butler-Volmer equations and its variations to potentiodynamic scan curves. The optimization process is powered by non-linear least squares algorithms from Scipy. It features a user-friendly plotting GUI with Jupyter Notebook widgets. This current release provides options for interactive data range selection, linear/log axis switching, auto-zoomed plotting, and post-IR compensation. The fitted results include corrosion parameters such as corrosion potential, corrosion current, Tafel slopes, polarization resistance, and goodness of fit (R2 score and Chi2 score).},
