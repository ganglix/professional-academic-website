abstract: Concrete has been used as the construction material of choice in harsh environments due to its good durability relative low cost. Reinforced concrete structures, on the other hand, exhibit some vulnerability under saline environments due to reinforcement corrosion. The penetration of chloride ions plays a crucial role in rebar corrosion and, hence, for the durability and service life of a structure. The problem is even more acute once cracking occurs.  Comprehension and correct modeling of transport of moisture and chemicals in damaged concrete under severe environmental conditions are the object of the present study. Chloride ionsâ€™ ingress in both the pre-cracked and cracked regimes has been addressed. The effect of a single crack allowed to interact with the surrounding matrix on the chloride ingress is investigated. The presence of cracks is shown to have a dramatic impact on chloride penetration. Moisture movement and chlorides ingress both, in the matrix and through the crack, are tested and modeled according to the models presented in this paper.

summary: This study investigates the role of chloride ion penetration in cracked structures. It addresses chloride ingress in both pre-cracked and cracked concrete, demonstrating the significant impact of cracks on chloride penetration, and models moisture and chloride movement under severe conditions.
