abstract: Maintaining the durability of reinforced concrete (RC) structures is crucial
  for sustainable infrastructure management. Rational-RC is a Python package that
  provides a probabilistic framework for modelling the life-cycle deterioration of
  RC structures. Designed with a modular, object-oriented architecture, it enables
  flexible integration of key deterioration processes, including membrane degradation,
  chloride ingress, carbonation, corrosion, and cracking within a unified limit-state
  reliability framework. Using site-specific field data, users can calibrate deterioration
  models to generate staged probabilities of failure, informing condition-based maintenance
  strategies that optimize costs and extend service life. The framework can be extended
  to interact with structural models, and scaled for simulation at both the element
  and network levels. Its visualization tools and extensible design make it a powerful
  tool for researchers and practitioners aiming to tackle the challenges of aging
  infrastructure with advanced computational approaches.

summary:

    This paper introduces Rational-RC, an open-source Python package designed to model the life-cycle deterioration of reinforced concrete (RC) structures using a probabilistic, modular framework. It integrates key deterioration mechanisms—such as chloride ingress, carbonation, corrosion, and membrane degradation—within a unified reliability-based approach. The tool supports calibration with site-specific field data and produces actionable predictions that support condition-based maintenance and infrastructure management.
