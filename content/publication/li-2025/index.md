abstract: This study presents a comprehensive mechanistic corrosion model to simulate
  rebar corrosion in non-uniform corrosive microenvironments caused by cracking and
  exposure conditions. The proposed model comprehensively investigates all possible
  corrosion mechanisms in cracked concrete, addressing an experimental phenomenon
  that has perplexed experts for decades. In particular, it aims to elucidate the
  marked difference in corrosion behaviour observed in the presence of thin versus
  wide cracks. This study demonstrates that self-healing is the sole mechanism differentiating
  the corrosion behavior of thin and wide cracks, a finding enabled by advanced numerical
  modeling and experimental validation. Achieving this required a sophisticated physics-based
  model capable of capturing the major features of reinforcement corrosion in cracked
  concrete. The ability to selectively activate or deactivate specific mechanisms
  in the model provides a unique lens to isolate their contributions, which is often
  impractical in experimental setups. The findings of this study provide valuable
  insights into the concept of a “critical crack width”, below which reinforcement
  corrosion is unlikely to pose a significant concern.
