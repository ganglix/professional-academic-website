abstract: 'This study deepens our understanding of rebar corrosion in cement-based
  materials like mortar and concrete, as compared to simulated pore solutions. The
  porous nature of mortar and variable water saturation levels are key factors that
  differentiate the corrosion behaviour of rebar in these real-world materials from
  that in bulk simulated pore solutions. While it is known that chloride ions, carbonation,
  and water saturation all contribute to rebar corrosion in concrete, their combined
  or synergistic effects have remained rather unclear. This research sheds light on
  these complex interactions by examining corrosion parameters for rebars in mortar
  with six levels of chloride content exposed to three levels of air relative humidity
  plus the immersed state, in carbonated and uncarbonated environments were determined
  and then analyzed by examining the water retention curves and bulk resistivity of
  these mortar samples. The effect of the water saturation level on corrosion was
  isolated from the combined effect of chloride contamination and carbonation and
  also their effects on bulk resistivity and water retention capacity. It was found
  that water saturation levels affect corrosion rates due to three factors: 1) an
  area effect, where the water content influences the rebar-pore solution area; 2)
  an ohmic control effect, where the bulk resistivity is influenced by water content;
  and 3) an anode-to-cathode ratio effect, where active or passive rebar surface conditions
  are influenced by water.In non-carbonated mortar, when there is no chloride, the
  main contributor to rebar corrosion rate is area effect. When there is chloride
  present, in addition to area effect, there also exists ohmic control and anode-to-cathode
  ratio effect. The chloride-indued rebar depassivation leads to non-uniform corrosion
  with a varying anode-to-cathode ratio dependent on water saturation. This non-uniform
  corrosion cell is at a scale large enough to be under ohmic control by the bulk
  resistivity, which is also dependent on water saturation.In carbonated mortar, the
  rebar corrosion behaviour is affected by both the anode-to-cathode ratio and the
  surface area. The rust scale on the rebar affects its anode-to-cathode ratio. When
  the rust scale is dry, the rebar is passivated, but when the scale is wet, the rebar
  becomes activated. This results in the dependence of the corrosion potential on
  the water saturation level in carbonated mortar. The degree of dependence varies
  based on the chloride content. When the chloride content is low, the electrical
  conductivity of the rust is highly dependent on water content, resulting in a more
  pronounced dependence of corrosion potential on water saturation. Conversely, when
  the chloride content is high, the dependence is less significant. The non-uniform
  corrosion cell occurs at a scale small enough that is not sensitive to bulk resistivity,
  resulting in less ohmic control. Finally, this study contributes towards the elucidation
  of the crucial link between rebar corrosion in simulated pore solutions and corrosion
  measurements within concrete or mortar samples.'
