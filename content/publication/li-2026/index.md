abstract: This study developed a methodology for quantifying the corrosion parameters
  such as corrosion potential, corrosion current density and Tafel slopes for rebar
  in simulated pore solutions and mortar with realistic rebar conditions. We quantitatively
  investigated the impact of depassivation duration, chloride concentration, carbonation,
  and relative humidity on these parameters. Specifically, in partially saturated
  mortar, it was observed that the critical chloride content lacked a distinct threshold.
  The degree of depassivation, as indicated by shifts in corrosion parameters due
  to chloride ions and carbonation, was influenced by humidity.
