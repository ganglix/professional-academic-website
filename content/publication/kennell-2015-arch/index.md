abstract: 'The University Bridge in Saskatoon is a multi-span concrete arch bridge
  with a service life that began in 1916. Rehabilitation of the bridge deck is currently
  underway and expected to be completed during the summer of 2015 with rehabilitation
  of the bridge arches and piers planned to occur in 10 to 15 years. This manuscript
  outlines an investigation taken to evaluate a number of different arch rehabilitation
  strategies using numerical models and experimental data. The rehabilitation strategies
  considered in this investigation include: do nothing, Fiber Reinforced Polymer wrap,
  Galvanic Cathodic Protection, Impressed Cathodic Protection, Re-alkalization, Electrochemical
  Chloride Extraction, and applying a Penetrating Sealer. Experimental data was obtained
  concerning properties of the concrete, pore solution, rebar, and environmental conditions
  within the concrete. Cores were removed for compression testing and pore solution
  composition analysis. Rebar was also removed for electrochemical testing, including
  potentiodynamic scans and long-term exposure tests. Semi-permanent probes were inserted
  to measure environmental properties inside the concrete related to water saturation
  and oxygen content. Values from these experimental data were then used in the development
  of numerical models. Simulations and measured data demonstrated low moisture levels
  and high oxygen content within the concrete were coupled with low/insignificant
  corrosion rates on the reinforcing metal in most regions. However, measured data
  suggested high negative half-cell readings could be associated with regions of high
  concrete moisture (above 60% by volume) due to surface runoff and water pooling
  on the arches. Numerical modeling and experimental data suggest the relatively low
  moisture levels within the concrete could be utilized and enhanced to mitigate the
  corrosion of reinforcing steel. Therefore, building on these conditions, a synergistic
  mitigation strategy was recommended that incorporated two technologies: discrete
  Galvanic Cathodic Protection anodes and a Penetrating Sealer. Calculated savings
  due to this study revealed savings of the order-of-magnitude in the range of $2
  to $4 million when compared with alternate rehabilitation strategies. Additionally,
  the results of the assessment demonstrate the age of a structure has limited bearing
  on the remaining service life. Rather, if the underlying deterioration processes
  are controlled or minimized, the life of the element can be extended indefinitely
  so long as regular monitoring is in place to identify changes in either the environment
  or condition of the element that would affect the deterioration rates. As such,
  with the proposed rehabilitation method the City will have a system that with regular
  monitoring, which is already part of their City wide asset management system, will
  be easily capable of meeting the desired 50 year service life extension at a minimal
  cost impact to the overall project.'
