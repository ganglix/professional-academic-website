This is a general computer science course offered to all students on campus. It introduces the basic computer science and computer programming principles of algorithms, abstraction, encapsulation, variables, conditional branching, repetition, functions, recursion, and elementary data structures. I also taught problem-solving applications such as data analysis and visualization, simulation, text processing, and image processing.
