title: CHE 453 Corrosion Engineering
summary: 'This is a fourth-year undergrad course that covers the principles of corrosion, corrosion control, and their application to the selection of construction materials and the protection of engineering systems. My students were from different majors in engineering, including civil, chemical, mechanical, and environmental. Corrosion theory is generally not well understood by many practitioners, despite the availability of standard methods in the corrosion industry. It is important for all engineers who are involved in corrosion management and metallic materials selection to have this theory upon which to base their decisions.
