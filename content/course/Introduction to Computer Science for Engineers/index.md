This is a computer science course tailored for engineering students. It was the first course that I taught using a competence-based evaluation method. Students must complete basic tasks with >95% mark and are allowed to refresh their grades when they achieve higher marks in more advanced tasks. This allows them to focus on gaining skills without the uncertainty of risking losing marks due to other causes.
