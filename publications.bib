   abstract = {The University Bridge in Saskatoon is a multi-span concrete arch bridge with a service life that began in 1916. Rehabilitation of the bridge deck is currently underway and expected to be completed during the summer of 2015 with rehabilitation of the bridge arches and piers planned to occur in 10 to 15 years. This manuscript outlines an investigation taken to evaluate a number of different arch rehabilitation strategies using numerical models and experimental data. The rehabilitation strategies considered in this investigation include: do nothing, Fiber Reinforced Polymer wrap, Galvanic Cathodic Protection, Impressed Cathodic Protection, Re-alkalization, Electrochemical Chloride Extraction, and applying a Penetrating Sealer. Experimental data was obtained concerning properties of the concrete, pore solution, rebar, and environmental conditions within the concrete. Cores were removed for compression testing and pore solution composition analysis. Rebar was also removed for electrochemical testing, including potentiodynamic scans and long-term exposure tests. Semi-permanent probes were inserted to measure environmental properties inside the concrete related to water saturation and oxygen content. Values from these experimental data were then used in the development of numerical models. Simulations and measured data demonstrated low moisture levels and high oxygen content within the concrete were coupled with low/insignificant corrosion rates on the reinforcing metal in most regions. However, measured data suggested high negative half-cell readings could be associated with regions of high concrete moisture (above 60% by volume) due to surface runoff and water pooling on the arches. Numerical modeling and experimental data suggest the relatively low moisture levels within the concrete could be utilized and enhanced to mitigate the corrosion of reinforcing steel. Therefore, building on these conditions, a synergistic mitigation strategy was recommended that incorporated two technologies: discrete Galvanic Cathodic Protection anodes and a Penetrating Sealer. Calculated savings due to this study revealed savings of the order-of-magnitude in the range of $2 to $4 million when compared with alternate rehabilitation strategies. Additionally, the results of the assessment demonstrate the age of a structure has limited bearing on the remaining service life. Rather, if the underlying deterioration processes are controlled or minimized, the life of the element can be extended indefinitely so long as regular monitoring is in place to identify changes in either the environment or condition of the element that would affect the deterioration rates. As such, with the proposed rehabilitation method the City will have a system that with regular monitoring, which is already part of their City wide asset management system, will be easily capable of meeting the desired 50 year service life extension at a minimal cost impact to the overall project.},

   abstract = {The model is firstly solved at the “open circuit mode” to find the OCP. In “scan mode”, the scan starts from the OCP, and increases/ decreases at a small increment (e.g. 0.5 mV) to alter the homogenized area-averaged rebar electrode potential, until it reaches to a given scan range bounds (e.g. OCP-300 mV or OCP+ 300 mV). The simulated potentiodynamic scan procedure was coded up in Python; the group of equations in both “open circuit model” and “scan mode” were numerically solved with iterative optimization algorithm from Scipy in Python ecosystem. To optimize the convergence during solving, solutions from the previous scan step were used as initial guesses for the next scan step.},

@article{Li2023homogenised,
   abstract = {When rebar corrosion parameters are characterised from an electrochemical polarisation curve, the non-uniform rebar surface conditions need to be considered. In this research, a circuit model was developed to simulate the polarisation behaviour of rebar in concrete. It is found that the resistivity of concrete leads to non-uniform potential on the rebar, which causes the polarisation curve of the entire rebar to deviate from the Butler–Volmer kinetics. This, in turn, leads to an overestimation of the Tafel constants and the corrosion current density. Such deviations are more pronounced with higher concrete resistivity, especially when the active and passive rebar surfaces have a similar area ratio. The study recommends using potentiodynamic scans of representative reinforced concrete samples of the field conditions or the calculated parameters using an averaging technique, such as the proposed circuit model, to obtain accurate E-I curves or parameters for electrochemical modelling and corrosion rate prediction.},

We quantitatively investigated the impact of depassivation duration, chloride concentration, carbonation, and relative humidity on these parameters. Specifically, in partially saturated mortar, it was observed that the critical chloride content lacked a distinct threshold. The degree of depassivation, as indicated by shifts in corrosion parameters due to chloride ions and carbonation, was influenced by humidity.},

@article{Li2023synergistic,
   abstract = {This study deepens our understanding of rebar corrosion in cement-based materials like mortar and concrete, as compared to simulated pore solutions. The porous nature of mortar and variable water saturation levels are key factors that differentiate the corrosion behaviour of rebar in these real-world materials from that in bulk simulated pore solutions. While it is known that chloride ions, carbonation, and water saturation all contribute to rebar corrosion in concrete, their combined or synergistic effects have remained rather unclear. This research sheds light on these complex interactions by examining corrosion parameters for rebars in mortar with six levels of chloride content exposed to three levels of air relative humidity plus the immersed state, in carbonated and uncarbonated environments were determined and then analyzed by examining the water retention curves and bulk resistivity of these mortar samples. The effect of the water saturation level on corrosion was isolated from the combined effect of chloride contamination and carbonation and also their effects on bulk resistivity and water retention capacity. It was found that water saturation levels affect corrosion rates due to three factors: 1) an area effect, where the water content influences the rebar-pore solution area; 2) an ohmic control effect, where the bulk resistivity is influenced by water content; and 3) an anode-to-cathode ratio effect, where active or passive rebar surface conditions are influenced by water.In non-carbonated mortar, when there is no chloride, the main contributor to rebar corrosion rate is area effect. When there is chloride present, in addition to area effect, there also exists ohmic control and anode-to-cathode ratio effect. The chloride-indued rebar depassivation leads to non-uniform corrosion with a varying anode-to-cathode ratio dependent on water saturation. This non-uniform corrosion cell is at a scale large enough to be under ohmic control by the bulk resistivity, which is also dependent on water saturation.In carbonated mortar, the rebar corrosion behaviour is affected by both the anode-to-cathode ratio and the surface area. The rust scale on the rebar affects its anode-to-cathode ratio. When the rust scale is dry, the rebar is passivated, but when the scale is wet, the rebar becomes activated. This results in the dependence of the corrosion potential on the water saturation level in carbonated mortar. The degree of dependence varies based on the chloride content. When the chloride content is low, the electrical conductivity of the rust is highly dependent on water content, resulting in a more pronounced dependence of corrosion potential on water saturation. Conversely, when the chloride content is high, the dependence is less significant. The non-uniform corrosion cell occurs at a scale small enough that is not sensitive to bulk resistivity, resulting in less ohmic control. Finally, this study contributes towards the elucidation of the crucial link between rebar corrosion in simulated pore solutions and corrosion measurements within concrete or mortar samples.},
