# my notes: 
#looks like this workflow only process the first publication of the same year
# reason: The issue with the GitHub Action only processing the first publication of each 
# year is likely due to these duplicate keys. In BibTeX, each entry must have a unique key 
# so that it can be distinctly identified. When multiple entries share the same key, 
# the system might only recognize the first one, ignoring the subsequent duplicates.
# To resolve this, you should assign a unique key to each publication entry, 
# especially those with the key Li2023. For example, you could use Li2023a, Li2023b, Li2023c, etc., 
# to differentiate them. After making these changes, the GitHub Action should be able to process all publications correctly.
